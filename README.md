# Nick Robb ‚Äî Cybersecurity Professional | AI-Enhanced Defense and Offensive Operations

Six months ago, I transitioned into cybersecurity from a non-technical background. Since then, I‚Äôve built a fully operational Security Operations Center (SOC) lab, passed the CompTIA Security+ certification, and documented real-world penetration testing and defense workflows.

Every project here is based on hands-on learning, automation, and practical application ‚Äî focused on building skills that solve real security problems.
