# Nick Robb — Cybersecurity Professional | AI-Powered Defender | SOC & Offensive Ops

Six months ago, I had no background in tech. Today, I’ve built a functioning SOC lab, passed CompTIA Security+, and simulate real-world cyber attacks and defenses from my own network. Every project here is documented to show what I’ve done, how I did it, and what I learned — not just to prove I can work in cybersecurity, but to prove I already am.

## Featured Projects

- **Cyber Threat Intel Bot**  
  Automated threat intelligence collection and summarization from sources like VirusTotal, AlienVault, and Shodan using Python and OpenAI.

- **SQL Injection Tester**  
  A custom script to automate SQLi vulnerability testing across web applications, built for efficiency in home lab and CTF scenarios.

- **Official Intelligence Blog**  
  Fully automated pipeline that generates and posts weekly cybersecurity blog content to Hashnode and LinkedIn using AI.

- **Chromecast IoT Hack**  
  Local-network IoT exploitation of a vulnerable Chromecast device. Includes documentation of setup, payload delivery, and lessons learned.

- **SOC-in-a-Box**  
  A self-contained SOC built on Windows Server 2025. Logs, alerts, real-time monitoring, automation scripts, and detection rules included.

## Technical Focus

- Defensive Security: SIEM, log parsing, incident detection and response, Windows event logging.
- Offensive Security: Vulnerability scanning, exploitation (Metasploit, Nessus), IoT testing, CVE targeting.
- AI + Automation: Python automation across blog posting, resume updates, threat intel gathering, LinkedIn content generation.
- Tools: Kali Linux, VMware, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, Flipper Zero, Hashcat, Nessus, Nmap, and more.
