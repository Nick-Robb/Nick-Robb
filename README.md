# Nick Robb — Cybersecurity Professional | AI‑Enhanced Defense and Offensive Operations

Six months ago, I transitioned into cybersecurity from a non‑technical background. Since then, I’ve built a fully operational Splunk‑based SIEM lab in AWS, passed the CompTIA Security+ certification, and documented real‑world penetration testing and defense workflows.

Every project here is based on hands‑on learning, automation, and practical application — focused on building skills that solve real security problems.
