# Nick Robb — Cybersecurity Professional | AI‑Enhanced Defense & Offensive Operations

> **Each solution here was conceived, built, and documented in days—starting from zero development or cybersecurity background—so I could prioritize CompTIA Security+ study while still delivering working automation and labs.**

> **Powered by AI:** These projects showcase my ability to leverage ChatGPT for rapid learning, problem‑solving, and automation. Without AI assistance, these prototypes would have taken me weeks or months instead of days.

Six months ago I left a non‑technical banking role to dive head‑first into cybersecurity. In that time I’ve:

- 🚀 Built and automated a Splunk‑based SIEM lab on AWS via Terraform (with AI‑guided HCL scripting)  
- ✅ Passed CompTIA Security+ (April 2025)  
- 🎯 Documented real‑world penetration tests (IoT, web apps, network services)  
- 🤖 Developed AI‑driven tooling for threat intelligence and blog publishing  

I’m now actively seeking remote Entry‑Level Cybersecurity Analyst or SOC Analyst roles. Rapid self‑starter—top 7% on TryHackMe.
